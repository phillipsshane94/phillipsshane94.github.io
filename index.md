# Welcome to phillipsshane94's GitHub Pages

Here are my various web projects that I've been doing as I learn HTML, CSS, Javascript, etc.
Please give the pages a minute or so to load the CSS.  For whatever reason, the CSS is not immediately applied to the page, but it will update after a bit of time. 

Here is a direct link to my github which has Google Foobar Challenges (I'd recommend looking at challenge 3) among some other things.  I'm currently learning Web Development so many of my updates will be front-end projects.

<!---
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/phillipsshane94/phillipsshane94.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- List

2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/phillipsshane94/phillipsshane94.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
